This exercise is about helping you to see the relationship between:

    - A normal variable
    - A pointer to that variable
    - A reference to that variable

    By printing addresses and values, you can visually confirm what each one really is in memory
    
(1) The string variable
        std::string str = "HI THIS IS BRAIN";
        - this creates a std::string object named str
        - str lives at some memory address (for example: 0x7ffee3a1b5c0)
        - this is the "original" object that everything else refers to

(2) The pointer
        std::string* stringPTR = &str;
        - stringPTR is a pointer
        - it stores the address of str
        - stringPTR itself is a variable with its own address, but its value is &str
            -> Key ideas:   ->  stringPTR   - contains an address
                            ->  *stringPTR  - the value at that address (the string itself)
    
(3) The reference
        std::string& stringREF = str;
        - stringREF is a reference, not a new object
        - it is an alias for str
        - it does not have its own memory address in the same sense
        - anywhere you use stringREF, the program treats it as str
            -> Key idea:    ->  a reference is just another name for the same variable
    
You must print three adresses:
        (1) Address of the string variable: &str
                ->  this is where the original string lives
        (2) Address held by the pointer: stringPTR
                ->  since stringPTR = &str, this will print the same address as &str
        (3) Address held by the reference: &stringREF
                ->  because stringREF is an alias for str, this will also print the same address
        =>  All three addresses should be identical
