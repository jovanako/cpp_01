This exercise teaches 3 specific things:
(1) File I/O in C++ (Stream manipulation)
(2) String manipulation algorithmics 
	(How to logically process text without relying on a "magic button" like .replace())
(3) Error handling in a standard C++ context

--- THE GOAL ---
->	You are recreating a very simplified version of the Unix command:

sed -i 's/s1/s2/g' filename

->	Your program needs to read a file, find every instance of string s1,
	change it to string s2, and save the result in a new file named <filename>.replace

->	You must use the C++ standard library streams:	->	std::ifstream (Input File Stream) to read
													->	std::ofstream (Output File Stream) to write
